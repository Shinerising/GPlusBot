Google+ Bot

Using the cURL functions in PHP to send your post and image to Google+.
None of Google+ official API is used(except the old Picasa Webalbum API)
You must type your Google+ ID and passward to make the page work, so it might NOT BE SAFE.

This Bot Can:
	Share your text post to the default circle("Your Circles") in Google+
	Share your text with one image(the image will be uploaded to Google Photos)
This Bot Cannot:
	Share post to a custom circle
	Share more than one photo at the same time
	Share post with one link that need to be previewed
	Share post to community
	Share post to pages
	Edit, comment and plus-one post
	
Google will check the location where the post is sent from, so you may get a notification about unusual location report from Google after you used this program. Just do as Google told you.
	
This program is not finished yet.If you are a newbie of PHP or feel terrible with Google+, please leave it alone.
